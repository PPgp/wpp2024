# wpp2024

## Introduction

**Maintainer's note:**

We are very pleased to provide the wpp2024 R package that contains various datasets from the newly published revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects, the [WPP 2024](https://population.un.org/wpp), released on July 11, 2024. The Population Estimates and Projection Section of the UN Population Division, under the leadership of Patrick Gerland, compiled these data, while dealing with difficult challenges including the impact of COVID on estimates and projections, as well as producing all datasets on a one year scale. 

In addition to the expert analysts working at the UN, Patrick Gerland  assembled an international group of respected  scientists to support this work, in order to ensure that the underlying methodology is cutting edge, including assessing uncertainty around estimates and projections.

For the first time, the population projections takes into account uncertainty about migration.

## About the R package

Although all the WPP data can be accessed from the [UN website](https://population.un.org/wpp), the **wpp2024** R package provides an easy way to access the main demographic indicators, including projection uncertainty. Unlike the previous **wpp** packages available on CRAN, this revision includes annual and 1-year age group (1x1) data. This makes the size of the package too big for a CRAN release, and thus it will be accessible from GitHub, as is the case of [wpp2022](https://github.com/PPgp/wpp2022). 

Five-year datasets are also included. These are not official UN datasets, but were provided by Patrick Gerland. 

**_New in this revision_:** Datasets on migration projection contain uncertainty bounds and are now available by age and sex.

## Installation and usage

As with any GitHub R package, you can install it using the **devtools** package. In addition, as the package is quite big you might need to increase the timeout for the download:

```
library(devtools)
options(timeout = 600)
install_github("PPgp/wpp2024")
```


All datasets described below can be accessed via the function `data()`, e.g. 

```
data(pop1dt)
pop1dt
```

Help files are available to give more details about the datasets. Simply type e.g. `?pop1dt`

## Dataset format


Previous **wpp** packages (up to **wpp2019**) provide datasets in a wide format, where countries and ages are in rows and years correspond to columns. In this revision, we follow the format of the **wpp2022** package, where most datasets are stored in a long format (countries, ages and time correspond to rows and indicators correspond to columns). However, to keep consistency and not to break any package dependencies, we offer the wide format as well. Note that many of these datasets are created on the fly using the stored long format. 
 
Thus, most indicators in the package are included in four versions (with the corresponding suffix in parentheses): 

1. Long format annual (`1dt`)
2. Long format 5-years (`5dt`)
3. Wide format annual (`1`)
4. Wide format 5-years (`5`, sometimes without any number)

We used the **data.table** package for the long format data, while wide datasets are returned as `data.frame`. 

In the following sections we summarize the main indicators. We only list the one-year datasets; for 5-year data, replace the number 1 in their names with 5. For example, `pop1dt` becomes `pop5dt`.

## Population datasets

**_Caution_:** All annual population datasets are considered to depict population to December 31 of each year. This is different from the official WPP release, which treats population at January 1. Thus, the population numbers in this package are shifted by one year when compared to the official UN data. E.g., population in year 2050 in the R package corresponds to 2051 in the UN data. Vital rates and counts at time t refer to the calendar year t, so that they yield population at time t in this R package.

The 5-year datasets are created so that vital rates observed/projected from January 1 of year t to December 31 of year t+4 correspond to population at January 1 of year t+5. E.g. population in 2055 in a 5x5 dataset corresponds to vital rates/counts aggregated over 2050.0-2054.99. Since the 5x5 population is considered to January 1st, it corresponds to the year t-1 in the annual 1x1 dataset, but matches the timing of the UN-published population. 

All values are in thousands.
